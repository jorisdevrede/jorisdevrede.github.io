Meadows defines a system as an interplay of stocks and flows. Stocks are the elements of the system that you can see, count, or measure at any time. Flows are the actions that change a stock over time. The stock can increase through an inflow, or decrease through an outflow. A basic example is the 'system' of a bathtub. The water in the bathtub is the stock . The stock can be increased with the faucet that acts as an inflow , and it can be decreased by drain that acts as an outflow . You can make the system as complex or as simple as you need it to be, depending on what it is you are analyzing. The bathtub can have an additional outflow, for example, from the water that evaporates. Whether that extra complexity is needed in your model of the system is up to you.","title":"Systems Thinking"},{"location":"systems/#systems-thinking","text":"In this section I look at subjects from 'systems' perspective, as defined by Donella Meadows in her book Thinking in Systems: A Primer .

If you view this \"Protection Against Misuse\" as a stock , then its inflows are the hardening of intended use and the patching of flaws that lead to unintended use. The outflow is the discovery of those flaws, or vulnerabilities . Hardening Taking measures to lower the attack surface of an application is called hardening. This means, for example, that you disable an administrative endpoint or limit the allowed login attempts. Both are intended functions of the application that you limit against misuse. The more you harden an application, the better it is protected against misuse. Vulnerabilities While failure to harden is also a vulnerability, we generally use the term for flaws in the code that open the application for unintended use. The discovery of these vulnerabilities lower the protection of the application. Technically the vulnerability is already there, making the \"Protection Against Misuse\" stock as low as all the still unknown vulnerabilities subtracted from it. In practice a vulnerability is only considered when it is actually discovered and can be acted upon. Additional vulnerabilities to consider are those lower in the operational stack of the application. A vulnerability in the underlying operating system, for example, could grant direct access to the application. That vulnerability then also subtracts from the protection of the application. Patching When a vulnerability is known, the application developer can fix the flaw and provide a new version of the application. Installing this new version for the purpose of removing the vulnerability is what we call patching. We should strive to always have the latest patch version of an application installed as it will provide the highest protection possible. Pentesting A penetration test, or pentest, is the feedback loop that measures the \"Protection Against Misuse\" stock by testing the hardening measures in place and the patches not in place. It can optionally be expanded to search for unknown vulnerabilities, discovering them during the test itself. This search is usually reserved for bespoke applications.","title":"Security"},{"location":"systems/security/#it-security","text":"The focus of IT security is the protection against misuse of applications.

It secures connections, but how seems a mystery. This leaves us with statements like \"your credit card data will be stolen when you use self-signed certificates\". Nobody knows, but it sounds scary enough so it must be true. Or is it? TLS has two main functions. The first is encrypting data in transit. The second is providing trust on a public network. Encryption is the important one, but it is trust that we get worked up about. Encryption TLS encrypts TCP packets between client and server, using a key that only they know. This ensures that only the client and server can read the data they exchange. No intermediate can eavesdrop. The details are more complex, but this is the essence. Data is secured between the two parties. That is it. Fail-fast This encryption is guaranteed, because TLS is a fail-fast protocol. If the communication cannot be encrypted, it will not happen. This contrary to the browser messages saying your connection might not be safe. These messages only apply to trust and never to encryption. Trust TLS can also provide trust about the server that the client connects to. The server provides a certificate that holds the server address and is signed by a third party. The client can choose to trust the third party and its signed confirmation of the server address. Trust on the public network Trust is relevant on an untrusted network where client data can be intercepted by an intermediate system that poses as the intended server. The client can then be tricked into leaking sensitive information like password or credit card data. The trust function verifies that the server is the intended address. In an uncontrolled network it is useful to assure that data is sent to the intended recipient. In a controlled network though, this is useless at best. Here is why. Commercial CA's Trust, or more accurately \"TLS host verification\", works by first trusting the certificate of the Certificate Authority (CA) that signed the server certificate. This will let the client trust all the server certificates that the CA signs. Browsers and operating systems are preconfigured to trust a list of commercial CA's and server certificates are bought from these CA's. So because Chrome trusts a bundle of CA's and the site you are browsing has a certificate that is signed by one of those CA's, you don't have to worry about TLS. How different that is on a private network. Rolling your own Trusting a preconfigured commercial CA is no different from trusting a CA that you create yourself. It provides the same level of trust. The difference is that a certificate from your own CA is free, which makes it preferable over commercial CA's. The downside of this is that you have to configure each client to trust your CA. This configuration comes at a cost as well. That is when you should evaluate trust itself. Is there a change that a client can connect to an unverified server? If so, make the investment of configuring each client with your CA. If not, then you are better off with turning host verification off in your TLS connections. It delegates trust to your known network and leaves you with encryption. No more, no less. But my browser says When you decide that servers are known and that host verfication has no added value in your particular context, there is still your browser that screams bloody murder. That is because TLS host verfication was designed for the internet with non-technical users in mind. Just click OK and know that your connection is encrypted and safe.","title":"Trusting TLS"},{"location":"tech/trust_tls/#trusting-tls","text":"TLS is one of the most used and least understood technologies.
