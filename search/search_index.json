The main input of this type of work should be function. Design Result: Diagrams with supporting descriptions and assumptions that form the basis of future builds or clarify recent new builds. A design satisfies a complex set of goals (requirements). Design requires detailed knowledge of the build options, which comes from both documentation and build experience. It might also require the knowledge of previous designs like frameworks and standards if they are available. So design work should be preceded by the search for such designs. Build Result: Automated deployment of a service or component that satisfies a clear goal. Build work requires a clear goal and optionally a design when available. Note that Build and Design form an interplay. Build work is the transformation of documentation and experience into an automated deployment.
